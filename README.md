# Advent of Code (AoC)
Testing my algorithmic skills using self taught Data Structures and Algorithms from MOOCs and online resources.

[AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly set of coding problems solvable from Dec 1 to 25, with 1 problem released per day. I recently got interested in solving these types of problems and am documenting my progress here.
